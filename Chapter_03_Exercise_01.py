# Exercise 1 : Rewrite your pay computation to give the employee 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked above 40 hours.

hrs = input('Enter Hours : ')
rate = input('Enter Rate : ')

hrs = float(hrs)
rate = float(rate)

if hrs > 40 :
  pay = ((hrs - 40) * rate * 1.5) + (40 * rate)
  print(pay)
else :
  pay = hrs * rate
  print(pay)
